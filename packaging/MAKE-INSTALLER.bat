title ISO - Make a Windows installer

REM ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
REM  Turns this source into ONE file you can send to anybody:
REM
REM      dist\ISO-<version>-windows.exe
REM
REM  The person receiving it needs nothing at all - no Visual Studio, no CMake,
REM  no git. They double-click it and ISO is installed.
REM
REM  You only need this if you want to GIVE ISO to someone. To install it on
REM  THIS machine, INSTALL-ISO.bat is the whole story.
REM
REM  This script does not need administrator rights: it builds and packs, it
REM  does not install. Refusing elevation it does not need is the honest thing
REM  to do.
REM
REM  No text echoed by this script may contain the characters greater-than,
REM  less-than, ampersand, pipe or caret - inside an echo Windows treats them as
REM  operators and silently mangles the output.

REM  This file ships at the bundle root AND in packaging\. Walk up if the source
REM  is the parent's, so the build lands where INSTALL-ISO.bat also puts it and

REM  against a SetupIconFile that is not there.

REM  still arrives as "" and ISCC rejects it as an invalid parameter, which
REM  would fail only on machines where the icon happened to be missing.
