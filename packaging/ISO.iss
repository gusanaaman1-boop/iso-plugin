; ISO - Windows installer, for Inno Setup 6.
;
; Do not run this by hand. MAKE-INSTALLER.bat builds ISO and then calls this
; with the version, the artefact folder and the icon already worked out:
;
;     MAKE-INSTALLER.bat   ->   dist\ISO-0.18.0-windows.exe
;
; It packs what the build produced; it never builds anything itself, so an
; installer can never ship a binary nobody compiled.
;
; NOT verified: there is no Windows machine here. Everything below is written to
; be checked on the first Windows run, and to fail loudly - at COMPILE time
; where possible - rather than install half of itself.
