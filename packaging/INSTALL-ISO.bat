title ISO - Build and Install

REM ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
REM  ONE file. Right-click it, "Run as administrator", and it does everything:
REM  checks what is installed, builds ISO, installs it, verifies it.
REM
REM  Modelled on FOUR COLOR's installer, which is the one that actually works
REM  on this user's machine. The four things ISO's old script got wrong and
REM  this one does not:
REM    1. it finds CMake INSIDE Visual Studio instead of demanding it on PATH;
REM    2. it names the generator explicitly instead of letting CMake guess;
REM    3. it uses the SHARED JUCE at %USERPROFILE%\JUCE - downloaded once for
REM       every plug-in, not re-cloned per project;
REM    4. it checks for administrator rights BEFORE a fifteen-minute build.
REM
REM  No text echoed by this script may contain the characters greater-than,
REM  less-than, ampersand, pipe or caret. In an earlier installer a greater-than
REM  inside echoed text became a redirection operator, mangled the output and
REM  broke the if-blocks badly enough to print DONE after NOT INSTALLED.
