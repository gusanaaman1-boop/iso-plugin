#
# pluginval is the industry's own validator (Tracktion, free, open source). It
# tests things the in-house suites deliberately do not: parameter fuzzing, bus
# layout negotiation, state restore from random data, editor open/close under
# load. Passing our 125 checks and failing this would still mean a plug-in that
# misbehaves in somebody's host.
#
# Strictness 10 is the maximum and is what this ships against.
